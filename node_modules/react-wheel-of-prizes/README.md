This component package is fully configurable. you should pass your own array of segColors, array of segments. these are compulsory while winningSegment is optional. if it is not provided then it will be completely random. there is a callback function onFinished where you will get the winning segment.

Also if you want to match with your theme, you can provide primary, contrast color and also the button text. these all are optional.

Now you can also control it's size and play with the upDuration and downDuration property to control it's speed.

Wheel of fortune will run only once by default but if you want to run it more than once then you need to pass `isOnlyOnce={false}`
